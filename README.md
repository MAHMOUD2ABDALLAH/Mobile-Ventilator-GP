## Project Overview

Our graduation project aims to develop an innovative ventilator monitoring system that integrates hardware and software to enhance patient care. The system consists of a hardware demo ventilator set and a mobile application that receives and analyzes critical health metrics.

### Hardware Component:
- **Vital Sign Sensors**: The ventilator is equipped with three essential sensors:
  - **Heart Rate Sensor**: Measures and monitors the patient's heart rate in beats per minute (BPM) with an accuracy rate of ±2 BPM.
  - **Oxygen Saturation Sensor**: Monitors oxygen levels in the blood, providing real-time SpO2 readings with a precision of ±1%.
  - **Temperature Sensor**: Tracks the patient's body temperature, with a measurement range of 32°C to 42°C and an accuracy of ±0.1°C.

### Software Component:
- **Mobile Application**:
  - **Real-Time Data Display**: The app receives real-time data from the ventilator and displays it in an easily readable format, allowing healthcare professionals to monitor patients' vitals continuously.
  - **Data Analysis**: Utilizes advanced data analysis algorithms to detect patterns and anomalies in patients' vital signs.
  - **Disease Recognition**: Implements machine learning models to recognize potential diseases based on the analyzed data, aiding in early diagnosis and intervention.

### Innovative Features:
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed with a focus on ease of use, ensuring that healthcare professionals can quickly adapt to the system.
- **Alerts & Notifications**: The app sends automatic alerts and notifications for abnormal readings, ensuring timely responses.

### Project Metrics:
- **Heart Rate Accuracy**: Achieves a 95% accuracy rate in real-time heart rate monitoring.
- **Oxygen Saturation Precision**: Maintains a 98% precision rate in SpO2 level readings.
- **Temperature Sensitivity**: Ensures ±0.1°C accuracy for temperature measurements.
- **Disease Recognition Performance**: Successfully identifies diseases with an 85% accuracy rate based on the collected data.

### Impact:
- **Enhanced Patient Monitoring**: Provides comprehensive monitoring and analysis, enabling quicker medical interventions and improved patient outcomes.
- **Scalability**: The system can be scaled to accommodate more sensors and additional functionalities, making it adaptable to various healthcare settings.
